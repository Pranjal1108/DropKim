HOW TO UPLOAD TO STAKE

1. Open this "math" folder.
2. Select ALL files inside it:
   - "base" folder
   - "bonus" folder
   - "index.json" file
3. Right-click > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder.
4. Upload that new zip file.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT zip the "math" folder itself. You must zip the CONTENTS of the folder so that "index.json" is at the very root of the zip file.
